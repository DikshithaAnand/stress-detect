## 📁 Project Structure

```
stress-app/
├── frontend/
│   └── index.html          ← Complete frontend (single-file app)
│
├── backend/
│   ├── main.py             ← FastAPI backend (all routes)
│   └── requirements.txt    ← Python dependencies
│
└── ml_model/
    └── train_model.py      ← ML model training script
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Train the ML Model

```bash
cd ml_model
python train_model.py
```

This generates `stress_model.pkl` in the `ml_model/` folder.

### Step 3: Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

API will be available at: `http://localhost:8000`
Swagger docs at: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Step 4: Open the Frontend

Simply open `frontend/index.html` in your browser.

-  **Note:** The frontend works in **demo mode** even without the backend.  
-  A rule-based engine provides predictions when the API is unavailable.
